		<h3>Explore existing thematic content</h3>
		<p>The user is enabled to discover and select a broad spectrum of existing thematic content on manifold urban themes provided on the TEP Urban platform. Moreover, the user can upload own data and content (e.g., statistics) and jointly analyse and visualise the available thematic layers based on state-of-the-art tools of Geographic Information Systems and visualization. Any openly available thematic content or generated result can be exported.</p>

		<h3>Task individual on-demand analyses</h3>
		<p>The TEP Urban platform offers the possibility to define and conduct on-demand processing and production of thematic content based on multi-mission remote sensing imagery (in particular ESA missions including the Sentinel suite and Landsat imagery) and additional data sources (e.g., cadastral data, statistics, socio-economic data). The additional data might either be publically available on the platform or individually uploaded by the user. For the processing and data analysis the TEP Urban platform provides high-level processing solutions, state-of-the-art algorithms and high-performance IT-infrastructures supporting large-scale and near-real-time data exploitation. These activities and functionalities are partially free and open, while others are provided on a pay-per-use basis.</p>

		<h3>Develop, deploy and offer your own content or application</h3>
		<p>To foster innovation and collaboration, the TEP Urban platform allows for the individual development and deployment of analysis techniques, thematic products and application-oriented services. Therefore, the platform offers interfaces to upload and run user-defined algorithms and processes and provides functionalities to develop own methods and products (e.g., by using the Sentinel tool boxes) directly on the platform. Developed applications or products can then be presented and shared at the TEP platform application and product store.</p>

		<h3>Learn more about innovative data sets and methods</h3>
		<p>The TEP Urban platform provides various opportunities to inform about innovative products, applications and initiatives and the latest state-of-the-art methods and solutions. These approaches and products might even be available for first testing on the platform by the interested user and the user can also contribute a rating of or feedback to the method or solution in order to support further optimisation and/or operationalisation.</p>
