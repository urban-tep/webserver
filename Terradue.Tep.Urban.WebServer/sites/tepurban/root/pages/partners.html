 		<h3>User Community</h3>
 		<p>The TEP Urban project addresses user communities on all levels relevant to the urban domain (global, European, national, regional, local). The main user community groups involved in TEP Urban are the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/" target="_blank">World Bank Group</a>, <a href="https://www.earthobservations.org/index.php" target="_blank">Group on Earth Observation</a>, <a href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/" target="_blank">European Environment Agency</a>, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/regional_policy/index_en.htm" target="_blank">DG Regio</a>, <a href="http://isocarp.org/" target="_blank">International Society of City and Regional Planners</a>, and <a href="http://www.prague.eu/en" target="_blank">City of Prague</a>.</p>

 		<h4>World Bank Group</h4>
 		<p>The World Bank Group was created at the end of World War II as a result of many European and Asian countries needing financing to fund reconstruction efforts. Created out of the Bretton Woods agreement of 1944 (along with three other institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, IMF), the Bank was successful in providing financing for these devastated countries. Today, the Bank functions as an international organisation that attempts to fight poverty by offering developmental assistance to middle and poor-income countries. By giving loans, and offering advice and training in both the private and public sectors, the Bank aims to eliminate poverty by helping people help themselves. According to its Articles of Agreement, all the decisions of the Bank must be guided by a commitment to the promotion of foreign investment and international trade and to the facilitation of capital investment. Presently, the staff includes economists, public policy experts, sector experts and social scientists, with about two thirds based in Washington, D.C. (USA) and one third based in country offices.</p>
 		<p>Since the past few years, the World Bank Group is supporting several ground-breaking initiatives related to urbanisation, including the Urbanisation Reviews, i.e. a diagnostics of 30 countries covering 53% of the global urban population, to help better understand how different actors coordinate their investment decisions in urban settings. Numerous funded projects support green, inclusive, resilient and competitive cities across the world, and at various stages of urban development.</p>
 		<p>World Bank Group is currently developing its Platform for Urban Mapping and Analysis (PUMA), which is complementary and can benefit from the TEP Urban infrastructure, products and services development.</p>

		<h4>Group on Earth Observation (GEO)</h4>
		<p>The GEO SB-04 Task is an international team of researchers and practitioners aimed at developing a Global Urban Observation and Information Task for GEO including, among others: the Indiana State University (USA), the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the Tsinghua University (China), the Chinese University of Hong Kong (China), the National Observatory of Athens (Greece), and the JRC (European commission).</p>
		<p>The Task has defined several targets for the GEO Work Plan period 2012-2015. These include, amongst others, the integration of global urban observations with i) data characterising urban ecosystems, built environment, air quality, and carbon emission; ii) indicators of population density, environmental quality, and quality of life; iii) patterns of human, environmental and infectious diseases. In particular, the Task team will aim at contributing to:
		<ul>
			<li>conducting global urban analyses, including time-series for assessing mega-cities development (e.g., urban sprawl) and a world-wide inventory of human settlements based on satellite data;</li>
			<li>creating a global urban morphological database for urban monitoring / assessment and climate modeling to better understand the impacts of global climate change on urban areas;</li>
			<li>defining requirements for global urban monitoring and assessment in terms of data products and expectations for data validation, archiving, update and sharing;</li>
			<li>in particular, the task will contribute, among others, to support the development of global urban observation and analysis systems and produce up-to-date information on the status and development of the urban system (from local to global scale).</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<h4>European Environment Agency (EEA)</h4>
		<p>The European Environment Agency (EEA) is an agency of the European Union. EEA main task is to provide sound, independent information on the environment. EEA is a major information source for those involved in developing, adopting, implementing and evaluating environmental policy, and also the general public. Located in Copenhagen, the EEA has currently 33 member countries. The EEA's mandate is:
		<ul>
			<li>to help the community and member countries make informed decisions about improving the environment, integrating environmental considerations into economic policies and moving towards sustainability;</li>
			<li>to coordinate the European environment information and observation network (Eionet).</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Main EEA clients are the European Union institutions - the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Council - and our member countries. In addition to this central group of European policy actors, EEA also serves other EU institutions such as the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. Besides, the business community, academia, non-governmental organisations and other parts of civil society are also important users of EEA information.</p>
		<p>The EEA interests in TEP Urban are manifold reflecting the agency role in the Copernicus Land Services implementation as well as urban theme specific activities in particular:
		<ul>
			<li>improvements driven by both technological developments, and the changes in EO input data volume and availability in form of working environments that include large data volume EO data access, computing resources, software and platform capabilities would play a crucial role in developing and enabling future Copernicus Land services. Resulting standardisation of processing software and toolboxes could enhance Copernicus Land Services repeatability and workflow transparency;</li>
			<li>advances based on urban EO/RS work in close thematic relation to the ongoing UA (urban atlas) exercise and the HRL imperviousness, but also relates to IUME activities on various urban topics including typologies of urban sprawl;</li>
			<li>urban indicators produced to support regular operational production of evolving set of EEA's urban thematic indicators.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<h4>DG Regio</h4>
		<p>The Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy is a Directorate-General of the European Commission.</p>
		<p>The DG Regional and Urban Policy is responsible for European Union measures to assist the economic and social development of the less-favoured regions of the European Union under Articles 158 and 160 of the Treaty of Rome. The mission of the European Commission's Directorate General (DG) for Regional and Urban Policy is to strengthen economic, social and territorial cohesion by reducing disparities between the levels of development of regions and countries of the European Union. In this way the policy contributes positively to the overall economic performance of the EU. Reducing disparities requires a cohesion policy promoting constant improvements in competitiveness and employment. By co-financing infrastructure projects, developing the information society, accelerating the transfer of know-how, supporting investments in people and stimulating cross-border cooperation, the Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy helps regions that are less prosperous or are suffering from structural problems to improve competitiveness and to achieve a faster rate of economic development in a sustainable way. The policy is thus an important expression of the solidarity of the European Union. In order to stimulate this mission, the Directorate General manages number of financial instruments: the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA). Beside, DG is also responsible for the implementation of the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF).</p>
		<p>DG Regional Policy aims to deliver (1) efficient and effective structural policies that (2) bring benefits to, and are understood by, Europeans citizens on the ground, (3) contribute directly to creating the conditions for the successful enlargement of the European Union and (4) are consistent with the principle of sound financial management.</p>
		<p>DG's REGIOgis which acts as specialised support service providing analysis, data, indicators, and maps for policy conception and reporting purposes, currently focuses on further data integration, resource sharing, link with (inter)national organisations and further analytical capacity supporting regional policy. These activities can be effectively supported by the TEP Urban platform infrastructure and services. Multi-scale approach of the TEP Urban platform can also support DG REGIO development of new regional and urban indicators within joint project with Eurostat, the OECD, the Joint Research Centre, the World Bank and the European Environmental Agency.</p>

		<h4>International Society of City and Regional Planners (ISOCARP)</h4>
		<p>The International Society of City and Regional Planners (ISOCARP) is a global association of experienced professional planners. It was founded in 1965 in a bid to bring together recognised and highly-qualified planners in an international network.</p>
		<p>The ISOCARP network brings together individual and institutional members from more than 80 countries worldwide. Members are planners and other stakeholders involved in the development and maintenance of the built environment. As a non-governmental organisation ISOCARP is recognised by the United Nations (UN), the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UNHCS/UN-HABITAT), and the Council of Europe. The Society also has a formal consultative status with the United Nations Education, Societal and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).</p>
		<p>Although ISOCARP members work in many different fields they share a common interest in the spatial and environmental dimensions of urbanisation. They advise key decision-makers, proposing and supporting projects for intervention in a spatial context through general or specific actions. The objectives of ISOCARP include the improvement of planning practice through the creation of a global and active network of practitioners. ISOCARP encourages the exchange of professional knowledge between planners, promotes the planning profession in all its forms, stimulates and improves planning research, training and education and enhances public awareness and understanding of major planning issues at a global level.</p>

		<h4>City of Prague</h4>
		<p>Prague is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic. It is the fourteenth-largest city in the European Union. The city is home to about 1.24 million people, while its larger and expanding urban zone is estimated to have a population of nearly 2 million. Prague Institute of Planning and Development (IPR) is a contributory organisation established by the City of Prague (MHMP) as an organisation focusing on strategic and regional planning and development of GIS datasets and service for the City of Prague.</p>
		<p>In accordance with its deed of foundation, the organisation conducts the following activities:
